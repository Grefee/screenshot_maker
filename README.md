Screenshot application

This application was made in order to be able to display any type of webcontent on television's browsers. And since webbrowsers don't support heavy js websites and display just blank white page.
I made and application which takes screenshots of desired websites, saves them in local folder, and then made a simple js website which load the img every second.. 
Therefore the televisions are able to load just img and are not required to use more resources than they have.

The app can be exported with pyinstaller into .exe file.
Config.txt file is there so we can set url of the desired webpage.
Therefore having multiple folders with multiple of these exe file with configs can result of having multiple screens to share accross company'S tvs.
